    <h2>Biyografi</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>John Burgess Wilson, better known by his pen name Anthony Burgess, was a British novelist, poet, composer, critic, linguist, and translator. </li>
    <li>He is best known for his dystopian novel “A Clockwork Orange.”</li>
    <li>He was born on February 25, 1917, in Manchester, England, and died on November 22, 1993, in London. He initially worked as a lecturer at the University of Birmingham and later as an educator in Malaya. From the mid-1950s onward, he focused increasingly on his writing career.</li>
    <li>Between 1954 and 1959, during his time teaching at schools in Malaya and Borneo, he wrote the Malayan Trilogy (Time for a Tiger, The Enemy in the Blanket, Beds in the East).</li>
    <li>In 1959, Burgess was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and was given less than a year to live. Determined to provide for his first wife, Lynne, he wrote five and a half novels within 12 months—only to later discover that the diagnosis had been incorrect. Nevertheless, he had already become a recognized author. He went on to write more than 50 novels and books.</li>
   </ul>
